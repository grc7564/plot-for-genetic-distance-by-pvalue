plot-for-genetic-distance-by-pvalue
===================================

Creates a scatterplot of the Genetic Distance (x) and the -log(pvalues) of data. The SNPWeights are colorized on a light blue-black gradient. Also creates a horizontal line at the -log(0.05) to show the point at which the values are statistically significant.
